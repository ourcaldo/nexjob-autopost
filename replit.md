# Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a minimal web project containing a single HTML file with a basic welcome page. The project appears to be in its initial state with no framework dependencies, backend services, or complex architecture implemented yet.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The current system consists of a single static HTML file served directly to the browser. There is no backend architecture, database layer, or server-side processing at this time.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Plain HTML
- **Structure**: Single-page static content
- **Styling**: None implemented (uses browser defaults)
- **JavaScript**: None implemented

### Backend Architecture
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Server**: None (static file serving only)
- **API**: None

## Key Components

1. **index.html**: The main entry point containing a basic HTML structure with a welcome message

## Data Flow

Currently, there is no data flow as the application serves static content:
1. Browser requests index.html
2. Server returns static HTML file
3. Browser renders the page

## External Dependencies

- **None**: The project has no external dependencies, frameworks, or libraries

## Deployment Strategy

The project can be deployed as static files on any web server or hosting platform:
- No build process required
- No server-side runtime needed
- Can be hosted on static hosting services (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- Simple file upload to web server sufficient for deployment

## Development Notes

This appears to be a starter project that could be expanded with:
- CSS styling and responsive design
- JavaScript functionality
- Backend API integration
- Database connectivity
- Modern framework adoption (React, Vue, etc.)
- Build tools and bundlers

The minimal structure provides a clean foundation for further development in any direction.
